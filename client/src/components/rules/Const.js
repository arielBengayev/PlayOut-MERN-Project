After finishing the game, the next game will open (note that you do not have the option to choose the games or their order, they open randomly), and this continues until the completion of the entire course of 5 games. If you are disqualified in a certain game, it will simply restart, but the timer will not reset, it will continue running. Your goal is to finish as quickly as possible in order to enter the top ten leaderboard. It is important to note that each game that opens will have a title with its name above it.`
